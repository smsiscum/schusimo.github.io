In Summer 2020, we have launched our two-staged study on the digital transformation of lean production systems with German industrial manufacturers. The first stage was an online survey with over 70 participants. For a detailed analysis of mainly scientific hypotheses, the second stage of the study is set up with over 20 expert interviews with professionals from leading German manufacturers such as Siemens, Schaeffler, and Continental until December 2020. The study will be published in the beginning of 2021 at Fraunhofer IPA and is partly financed by the Future Work Lab project.
