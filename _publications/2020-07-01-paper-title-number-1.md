Lean Production Systems (LPS) are an enterprise-specific set of strategic goals and principles in combination with operative methods and tools for the holistic management of production processes. Since LPS such as the Toyota Production System have been successfully established in many companies during the past decades, they are nowadays challenged by digital transformation, especially on the level of methods and tools. Therefore, this paper gives a literature review on digital transformation and LPS. As a result, main indicators for digitally driven change within LPS are identified.
