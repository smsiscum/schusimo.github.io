Participatory design aims to actively involve all stakeholders in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable. By introducing participatory design to the digital transformation of manufacturing enterprises, workers in their role as the central (end-)users of the system are integrated into important innovation processes. Thus, new types of manufacturing organization with bottom-up innovation from within the workforce can be realized.
Our aim is to benefit the digital transformation of manufacturing enterprises by introducing human-centered methods and technologies through participatory design. Our research intends to involve relevant case studies from manufacturing enterprises and provides significant industrial impact by enabling an innovation capability shift towards individuals, including the manufacturing workforce. When implemented systematically and holistically, manufacturing enterprises, unions, and individuals will benefit from the improvements made possible by participatory design for digital transformation.
